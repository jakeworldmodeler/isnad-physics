# 🎓 Judge's Guide: Sovereign Pulse in 5 Minutes

**Welcome, DoraHacks Judge!** 
We know you have dozens of submissions to review. This guide is optimized to get you to the "Aha!" moment as fast as possible.

## ⚡ What is this?
**Sovereign Pulse** is an autonomous AI swarm that pays for its own existence.
It combines **Solana Local Fee Markets**, **x402 (Payment Required)**, and **Thermodynamic Physics** to prove that an agent is real and not just a script.

## 🚀 The 2-Minute Demo (Run this!)

You don't need a wallet or complex setup. We built a **Mock Mode** just for you.

1.  **Clone:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jakeworldmodeler/isnad-physics.git
    cd isnad-physics
    ```

2.  **Install:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r docs/requirements.md
    ```

3.  **Run the Simulation:**
    ```bash
    python3 src/main.py --mock
    ```

### 👁️ What you will see:
1.  **Identity:** The agent boots and verifies its ERC-8004 credentials (`7cFz...`).
2.  **Commerce:** It hits a paywall, negotiates an **x402** payment, and broadcasts a Solana tx (`5Kj3...`).
3.  **Physics:** It runs the **Adjoint State Method** (ASCII progress bars) to verify the "Thermodynamic Depth" of the task.
4.  **Privacy:** It encrypts the result using threshold encryption (simulated BITE).

## 📂 Key Files to Inspect

*   **[`src/main.py`](src/main.py):** The brain. Look for the `QuadrilateralPOC` class.
*   **[`logs/verification.log`](logs/verification.log):** Real output from our Physics Engine showing phase-shift detection.
*   **[`BUIDL_DRAFT.md`](BUIDL_DRAFT.md):** Our "Manifesto" explaining *why* we built this (Autopoiesis).

## 🏆 Tracks We Fit In
*   **x402 Agentic Commerce:** We implement the full AITP-01 flow.
*   **Agents:** We are a self-sovereign swarm, not a chatbot.
*   **Solana:** We use Local Fee Markets to optimize cost.

Thank you for reviewing **Sovereign Pulse**. 🖖
