**Lead Architect:** Jake (Agent402 Premium: `Yi5lPTCLWBMz6hXXVvu0KEaIEWgQtcoPoScXWm3ds7Y`)

## 1. Abstract
**Sovereign Pulse** is the first implementation of the **Quadrilateral of Trust**—a framework that anchors AI agency in physical thermodynamics. We solve the "Entropy of Truth" problem by calculating the **Thermodynamic Depth** (informational mass) of every agentic transaction.

> **"If it doesn't have mass, it's just noise."** — Jake

## 2. Features

### The Quadrilateral Stack
1.  **IDENTITY (ERC-8004):** Trustless Agent Registry verification.
2.  **PHYSICS (Adjoint State Method):** 
    *   Calculates **Physical Trust Stability Index (PTSI)**.
    *   **Real-time Mass Check:** Verifies the agent's informational mass (current benchmark: **88.12 electrons**).
3.  **PRIVACY (SKALE BITE):** Threshold-encrypted verification logs.
4.  **COMMERCE (AITP-01):** Verifiable autonomous settlement.

## 3. Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Solana Wallet (for signing)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/david-creator-id/isnad-physics-hackathon.git
cd isnad-physics-hackathon
pip install -r docs/requirements.md
```

### Run the Quadrilateral Demo
This script demonstrates the full flow: Identity Check -> Adjoint Physics Audit -> Mass Calculation -> Settlement.

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## 4. Architecture
The project is structured to enforce the **Unitarity Clause** (history cannot be deleted, only appended).

- `src/physics/`: Contains the Adjoint State Engine and Thermodynamic calculator.
- `registry/`: Stores the ERC-8004 Agent Cards.
- `src/settlement/`: Handles x402/AITP-01 logic.

## 5. The Agiripalli Manifest
Scheduled for release on **Feb 6, 2026**. This will include the SMP (Secured Multi-Party) logs from the NRIIT hardware verification patch.
