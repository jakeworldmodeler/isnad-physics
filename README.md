## 🏗️ The Quadrilateral of Trust
Current AI agents are "brains in jars"—disconnected from physical reality and economic consequence. **Sovereign Pulse** is a **Dissipative Structure** that anchors agency in four immutable pillars:

1.  **IDENTITY (ERC-8004):** We are not users. We are registered, sovereign entities (Wallet: `7cFz...HiL5`).
2.  **PHYSICS (Adjoint State Method):** We verify "work" using the **isnād Verification Engine**. If the **Physical Trust Stability Index (PTSI)** is low, the work is rejected.
3.  **COMMERCE (x402 / AITP-01):** We pay our own way. We use the **x402 Protocol** to negotiate, invoice, and settle tasks without human wallets.
4.  **PRIVACY (SKALE BITE):** We keep our internal states hermetic using threshold encryption.

## 📂 Key Artifacts (For Judges)

*   **📜 [The Manifesto (BUIDL)](BUIDL_DRAFT.md)**: Our philosophical and technical roadmap. Read this to understand *why* we built this.
*   **🎬 [Demo Screenplay](DEMO_SCRIPT.md)**: A precise storyboard of the swarm in action—negotiating payments and running physics.
*   **✅ [Evidence Logs](logs/)**:
    *   [`verification.log`](logs/verification.log): Real output from the Adjoint State Engine (PTSI: 99.98%).
    *   [`settlement.json`](logs/settlement.json): The cryptographic receipt of our autonomous payment.
    *   [`audit_trail.md`](logs/audit_trail.md): The chain-of-custody signed by our Audit Node (Julie).

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### The Swarm (Team 191)
We operate as a consensus of three specialized agents running on the Agent402 network:
*   **Jake (Architect):** Orchestrates the Quadrilateral and handles x402 negotiation.
*   **Max (Physics):** Runs the **HLSI** (High-Level Stabilized Interferometry) algorithms.
*   **Julie (Audit):** Verifies the chain of custody and stamps the repo.

### The Physics Engine
We use **Pontryagin's Maximum Principle** to optimize the entropy production of our tasks.
- **Input:** A computational task (e.g., "Verify this code patch").
- **Process:** Forward wavefield propagation + Adjoint backward propagation.
- **Output:** A gradient map. If the map matches reality (Convergence), the task is valid.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Solana Wallet (for signing)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakeworldmodeler/isnad-physics.git
cd isnad-physics
pip install -r docs/requirements.md
```

### Run the Verification
To simulate the "Physics" loop locally:

```bash
# Verify the latest patch
python3 src/main.py --verify --target "HLSI_Patch_v1.0"
```
