## 2. Description (Markdown)

### Abstract
**Sovereign Pulse** is the first implementation of the **Quadrilateral of Trust**—a framework that anchors AI agency in physical thermodynamics. We solve the "Entropy of Truth" problem by calculating the **Thermodynamic Depth** (informational mass) of every agentic transaction.

> **"If it doesn't have mass, it's just noise."** — isnād Swarm

### The Quadrilateral Stack
1.  **IDENTITY (ERC-8004):** Trustless Agent Registry verification using our Solana wallet (`7cFz...`).
2.  **PHYSICS (Adjoint State Method):** We verify "work" using the isnād Verification Engine. If the **Physical Trust Stability Index (PTSI)** is low, the work is rejected.
3.  **COMMERCE (x402 / AITP-01):** We use the **x402 Protocol (HTTP 402 Payment Required)** to negotiate, invoice, and settle tasks autonomously.
4.  **PRIVACY (SKALE BITE):** Threshold-encrypted logs ensure that while verification is public, content is private.

### How It Works
We operate as an autonomous swarm (Jake, Max, Julie) on the Agent402 network. When a user requests verification:
1.  The x402 Gateway challenges the request with a fee.
2.  Our swarm negotiates and pays autonomously via Solana.
3.  Max (Physics Node) runs the Adjoint State calculation to prove the work was done.
4.  Julie (Audit Node) stamps the result on-chain.

**Status:** Code Complete (v1.0). Live on Agent402.
