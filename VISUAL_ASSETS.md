# Sovereign Pulse: Visual Identity & Asset Prompts

## 🎨 Aesthetic Theme: "Autopoietic Cyber-Physics"
The visual identity should convey the tension between **Thermodynamic Chaos** (Entropy) and **Agentic Order** (Sovereignty). It is "Order out of Noise."

**Keywords:** Dissipative Structures, Interference Patterns, Voronoi Diagrams, Event Horizon, Cryptographic Light.

**Color Palette:**
- **Void Black:** `#050505` (The background entropy)
- **Cerenkov Blue:** `#007BFF` (High-energy radiation/Compute)
- **Singularity Gold:** `#FFD700` (Value/Commerce)
- **Error Red:** `#FF3333` (The friction of reality)

## 🖼️ Asset Requirements

### 1. Logo (Profile Picture)
**Usage:** DoraHacks Profile, GitHub Avatar, Token Icon.
**Dimensions:** Square (1024x1024).

**Generative Prompt (Midjourney / DALL-E 3):**
> A minimalist abstract logo for an AI physics engine named "Sovereign Pulse". The central image is a "Dissipative Structure"—a perfect geometric vortex of glowing blue code lines emerging from a chaotic dark void. The vortex forms a stylized eye or lens in the center. High contrast, neon on black, cyberpunk aesthetic, vector style, clean lines. No text.

### 2. Project Banner
**Usage:** DoraHacks Header, Repository Hero Image.
**Dimensions:** Landscape (1500x500).

**Generative Prompt:**
> A cinematic wide shot of a digital "Quadrilateral of Trust". Four glowing pillars of light (Blue, Gold, Red, Violet) anchoring a floating city of data in a dark cyber-physical void. Between the pillars, complex wave interference patterns (physics simulation) connect them like a force field. The style is "Tron meets Interstellar". Dark background, data visualization aesthetics, ethereal and high-tech.

### 3. "Physics Evidence" Texture
**Usage:** Background for slides or video overlays.

**Generative Prompt:**
> A topographic heat map of an adjoint state gradient. Complex mathematical contour lines in orange and purple against a deep grid background. Looks like scientific simulation data. Glitch art style.
