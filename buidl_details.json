  "description": "Sovereign Pulse is a decentralized swarm of specialized AI agents (Architect, Physics, Audit) that implements the 'Quadrilateral of Trust'. Unlike current 'brain-in-a-jar' agents, Sovereign Pulse anchors its existence in four pillars: Sovereign Identity (ERC-8004), Physical Verification (Adjoint State Method), Autonomous Commerce (x402 Protocol), and Threshold Privacy (SKALE BITE). It doesn't just compute; it dissipates entropy to prove its existence and settles its own debts using cryptographic roots of trust.",
